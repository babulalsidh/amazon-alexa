5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Loved it!	1
4	31-Jul-18	Walnut Finish	Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Music	1
5	31-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do.	1
3	31-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	looks great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish	I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Love, Love, Love!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish	Just what I expected....	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	I love it, wife hates it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	Amazing product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Just like the other one	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great	1
3	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	This device is awesome!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	So far so good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric	Great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
2	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	I love you so much	1
